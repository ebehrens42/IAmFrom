        <p>I Am From...<br />
        By: Ella Behrens</p><br />

        <p>
            I am from my green tin cup and instant coffee <br />
            From my designated spot on the couch and my yellow pillow <br />
            I am from the 26th floor of my parents old, brick house <br />
            I am from the english ivy and the willow that never seemed to weep <br />
            I'm from pinball tournaments and screaming over card games <br />
            From Biggie G and Breezy Cheese <br />
            I'm from Turkey Trots and sand castles <br />
            and from shih tzus snuggled on the couch <br />
            I'm from "Hurry up" and "We're always late for school!" <br />
            I'm from lakefront runs and Washington Park races <br />
            I'm from downtown Chicago and rural Iowa <br />
            I'm from hotdogs on the beach and Applebees <br />
            From riding on my mom's handlebars <br />
            and basketball games with my dad <br />
            I am from the photos on my wall that remind me every day <br />
            of the joy and the love 
            that I've felt in this life.
